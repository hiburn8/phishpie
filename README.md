# phishpie
a phishing campaign framework in the making.

This initial upload includes the campaign landing-page core (Backboard - index.php), and the campaign data visialisation page (Dashboard - dashboard.php). Included is also a demo langing-page template (generic.php). Landing-page templates can be simple HTML files containing the phishing pages, but can also include php for custom logic in that template.

Warning: I wouldn't actually recommend trying to use PhishPie atm. A more usable alternative would be: https://github.com/cyberconsultant3199/Phishing-KIngphisher , that said... PhishPie will *eventually* have a lot of functionality that KIngphisher does not.
